#To Install

You need compile the `snake.pas`

On Linux you need to install `fpc` packet:

    # apt-get install fpc

Compilling:

    $ cd directory-of-snake
    $ fpc snake.pas

Maybe you will need to alter the `uses` block adding `uses crt` to linux and `uses wincrt` to windows

After compiled just:

    $ ./snake
